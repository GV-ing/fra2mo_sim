# fra2mo_sim

## Overview

This repository contains the core packages used to simulate **fra2mo**, a differential-drive mobile robot developed for educational and research purposes.

The project has two main goals:

1. **Technical reference**: document the software architecture and runtime logic of the robot in a ROS 2 Humble environment.
2. **Operational guide**: provide a practical workflow for developing, extending, and testing a generic differential-drive robot in simulation before deploying software to real hardware.

The repository is designed to provide a reproducible development environment based on Docker, reducing host-side dependency conflicts and making the simulation stack easier to share across different machines.

## Repository Structure

The workspace is organized around two main directories:

- **`docker_scripts/`**: scripts and configuration used to build, run, and access the Docker-based development environment.
- **`src/`**: ROS 2 packages and simulation assets, including robot description, navigation configuration, sensors, maps, and launch files.

This setup keeps the host system clean while giving every developer the same execution environment.

## Docker Environment

The `docker_scripts/` directory contains the automation needed to manage the container lifecycle.

| File | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`Dockerfile`** | Defines the base image built around Ubuntu 22.04 and ROS 2 Humble, installs Gazebo Harmonic support, and prepares the workspace used inside the container. |
| **`docker_build_image.sh`** | Builds the Docker image. Run it the first time and whenever the Dockerfile changes. |
| **`docker_run_container.sh`** | Starts the container and configures X11 forwarding so GUI applications such as Gazebo and RViz can run from inside the container. |
| **`docker_connect.sh`** | Opens an additional shell inside a running container, which is useful for monitoring topics or running commands in parallel. |

### Why Docker Is Used

Containerization is a technical choice, not just a convenience feature. It provides:

1. **Isolation**: every developer uses the same versions of ROS 2, Nav2, Gazebo, and related dependencies.
2. **Faster setup**: environment provisioning takes minutes instead of manually reproducing a full robotics stack.
3. **Portability**: software developed in simulation can be transferred more reliably to the onboard computer used on the real robot.

## Quick Start

To prepare and launch the environment for the first time:

```bash
chmod +x docker_scripts/*.sh
./docker_scripts/docker_build_image.sh
./docker_scripts/docker_run_container.sh
```

Once the container is running, you can attach additional shells with:

```bash
./docker_scripts/docker_connect.sh
```

## ROS 2 Packages in `src`

The `src/` directory contains the main ROS 2 packages that define the **fra2mo** simulation stack. The workspace is split into two complementary modules: one focused on robot modeling and simulation assets, and one focused on navigation.

### fra2mo_description

This package defines the physical and visual representation of the robot. It includes the URDF/Xacro description, simulated sensors, Gazebo worlds, RViz configuration, and custom support nodes.

#### Main contents

- **`urdf/`**: Xacro files describing the differential-drive robot, including links, joints, and reusable sensor macros.
- **`meshes/`** and **`models/`**: 3D geometry and simulation assets for the robot and the environment.
- **`worlds/`**: SDF worlds used in simulation, including the race field environment.
- **`launch/`**: launch files used to start the robot description stack, Gazebo, and RViz.
- **`conf/`**: RViz configuration files for a ready-to-use visualization setup.
- **`src/`**: custom nodes, such as the joystick-to-`cmd_vel` interface.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** and **`package.xml`**: build configuration and package metadata.

#### Launch files
The `fra2mo_description` package includes two main launch files that coordinate the startup of the software environment. Although they are commonly used together, they serve different purposes:

* **`fra2mo_gazebo.launch.py`**: Manages the physical simulation environment in **Gazebo Harmonic**. It computes the robot dynamics, simulates sensors, and loads the virtual world (`.sdf`). It is the simulation engine that generates the runtime data.
```bash
ros2 launch fra2mo_description fra2mo_gazebo.launch.py
```
* **`fra2mo_rviz.launch.py`**: Starts the monitoring and visualization interface in **RViz2**. It does not simulate physics; instead, it subscribes to runtime topics such as lidar point clouds, TF transforms, and camera data, and renders them in a 3D view for the operator.
```bash
ros2 launch fra2mo_description fra2mo_rviz.launch.py
```




### fra2mo_navigation

This package contains the navigation stack configuration and spatial perception tools used by the robot.

#### Main contents

- **`maps/`**: maps generated or used by localization and navigation workflows.
- **`launch/`**: launch files for SLAM and AMCL workflows.
- **`config/`**: Nav2 parameter files used to configure autonomous navigation behavior.
- **`CMakeLists.txt`** and **`package.xml`**: build configuration and package metadata.

#### Main capabilities

- **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)**: allows the robot to map an unknown environment using lidar and odometry data.
```bash
ros2 launch fra2mo_navigation slam.launch.py
```
- **AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)**: localizes the robot inside a previously generated map.
```bash
ros2 launch fra2mo_navigation amcl.launch.py
```
- **Nav2 integration**: provides planners, controllers, and recovery behaviors for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance. It is launched automatically for both files.


## Submodules

The packages inside `src/` are managed as Git submodules:

- `src/fra2mo_description`
- `src/fra2mo_navigation`

This design choice is practical, as it allows us to modify individual packages more easily and recall them for other projects if necessary.
If you clone the repository from scratch, initialize them with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

If the submodule pointers are updated in this repository, make sure to pull the latest changes and refresh them locally.

## Build Notes

Whenever changes are made to packages, you need to run,inside the container, the following commands:


```bash
colcon build
source install/setup.bash
```
